<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Effie!</span> What the devil
are you up to?"</p>

<p>Her husband's voice,
chopping through her mood of
terrified rapture, made her heart
jump like a startled cat, yet by
some miracle of feminine self-control
her body did not show
a tremor.</p>

<p><i>Dear God</i>, she thought, <i>he
mustn't see it. It's so beautiful,
and he always kills beauty.</i></p>

<p>"I'm just looking at the Moon,"
she said listlessly. "It's green."</p>

<p><i>Mustn't, mustn't see it.</i> And
now, with luck, he wouldn't. For
the face, as if it also heard and
sensed the menace in the voice,
was moving back from the window's
glow into the outside dark,
but slowly, reluctantly, and still
faunlike, pleading, cajoling,
tempting, and incredibly beautiful.</p>

<p>"Close the shutters at once,
you little fool, and come away
from the window!"</p>

<p>"Green as a beer bottle," she
went on dreamily, "green as
emeralds, green as leaves with
sunshine striking through them
and green grass to lie on." She
couldn't help saying those last
words. They were her token to
the face, even though it couldn't
hear.</p>

<p>"Effie!"</p>

<p>She knew what that last tone
meant. Wearily she swung shut
the ponderous lead inner shutters
and drove home the heavy bolts.
That hurt her fingers; it always
did, but he mustn't know that.</p>

<p>"You know that those shutters
are not to be touched! Not for
five more years at least!"</p>

<p>"I only wanted to look at the
Moon," she said, turning around,
and then it was all gone&mdash;the
face, the night, the Moon, the
magic&mdash;and she was back in the
grubby, stale little hole, facing an
angry, stale little man. It was
then that the eternal thud of the
air-conditioning fans and the
crackle of the electrostatic precipitators
that sieved out the dust
reached her consciousness again
like the bite of a dentist's drill.</p>

<p>"Only wanted to look at the
Moon!" he mimicked her in falsetto.
"Only wanted to die like a
little fool and make me that much
more ashamed of you!" Then his
voice went gruff and professional.
"Here, count yourself."</p>

<p>She silently took the Geiger
counter he held at arm's length,
waited until it settled down to a
steady ticking slower than a
clock&mdash;due only to cosmic rays
and indicating nothing dangerous&mdash;and
then began to comb her
body with the instrument. First
her head and shoulders, then out
along her arms and back along
their under side. There was something
oddly voluptuous about her
movements, although her features
were gray and sagging.</p>

<p>The ticking did not change its
tempo until she came to her
waist. Then it suddenly spurted,
clicking faster and faster. Her
husband gave an excited grunt,
took a quick step forward, froze.
She goggled for a moment in
fear, then grinned foolishly, dug
in the pocket of her grimy apron
and guiltily pulled out a wristwatch.</p>

<p>He grabbed it as it dangled
from her fingers, saw that it had
a radium dial, cursed, heaved it
up as if to smash it on the floor,
but instead put it carefully on
the table.</p>

<p>"You imbecile, you incredible
imbecile," he softly chanted to
himself through clenched teeth,
with eyes half closed.</p>

<p>She shrugged faintly, put the
Geiger counter on the table, and
stood there slumped.</p>

<p>He waited until the chanting
had soothed his anger, before
speaking again. He said quietly,
"I do suppose you still realize
the sort of world you're living
in?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> nodded slowly, staring at
nothingness. Oh, she realized,
all right, realized only too well.
It was the world that hadn't
realized. The world that had gone
on stockpiling hydrogen bombs.
The world that had put those
bombs in cobalt shells, although
it had promised it wouldn't, because
the cobalt made them much
more terrible and cost no more.
The world that had started
throwing those bombs, always
telling itself that it hadn't thrown
enough of them yet to make the
air really dangerous with the
deadly radioactive dust that came
from the cobalt. Thrown them
and kept on throwing until the
danger point, where air and
ground would become fatal to all
human life, was approached.</p>

<p>Then, for about a month, the
two great enemy groups had hesitated.
And then each, unknown to
the other, had decided it could
risk one last gigantic and decisive
attack without exceeding the
danger point. It had been planned
to strip off the cobalt cases, but
someone forgot and then there
wasn't time. Besides, the military
scientists of each group were confident
that the lands of the other
had got the most dust. The two
attacks came within an hour of
each other.</p>

<p>After that, the Fury. The Fury
of doomed men who think only of
taking with them as many as possible
of the enemy, and in this
case&mdash;they hoped&mdash;all. The Fury
of suicides who know they have
botched up life for good. The
Fury of cocksure men who realize
they have been outsmarted by
fate, the enemy, and themselves,
and know that they will never be
able to improvise a defense when
arraigned before the high court of
history&mdash;and whose unadmitted
hope is that there will be no high
court of history left to arraign
them. More cobalt bombs were
dropped during the Fury than
in all the preceding years of the
war.</p>

<p>After the Fury, the Terror.
Men and women with death sifting
into their bones through their
nostrils and skin, fighting for bare
survival under a dust-hazed sky
that played fantastic tricks with
the light of Sun and Moon, like
the dust from Krakatoa that
drifted around the world for
years. Cities, countryside, and air
were alike poisoned, alive with
deadly radiation.</p>

<p>The only realistic chance for
continued existence was to retire,
for the five or ten years the
radiation would remain deadly,
to some well-sealed and radiation-shielded
place that must also
be copiously supplied with food,
water, power, and a means of air-conditioning.</p>

<p>Such places were prepared by
the far-seeing, seized by the
stronger, defended by them in
turn against the desperate hordes
of the dying ... until there were
no more of those.</p>

<p>After that, only the waiting, the
enduring. A mole's existence,
without beauty or tenderness, but
with fear and guilt as constant
companions. Never to see the
Sun, to walk among the trees&mdash;or
even know if there were still
trees.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she realized what the
world was like.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> understand, too, I suppose,
that we were allowed
to reclaim this ground-level apartment
only because the Committee
believed us to be responsible
people, and because I've been
making a damn good showing
lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hank."</p>

<p>"I thought you were eager for
privacy. You want to go back to
the basement tenements?"</p>

<p><i>God, no! Anything rather than
that fetid huddling, that shameless
communal sprawl. And yet,
was this so much better? The
nearness to the surface was
meaningless; it only tantalized.
And the privacy magnified Hank.</i></p>

<p>She shook her head dutifully
and said, "No, Hank."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't you careful?
I've told you a million times,
Effie, that glass is no protection
against the dust that's outside
that window. The lead shutter
must never be touched! If you
make one single slip like that
and it gets around, the Committee
will send us back to the lower
levels without blinking an eye.
And they'll think twice before
trusting me with any important
jobs."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Hank."</p>

<p>"Sorry? What's the good of being
sorry? The only thing that
counts is never to make a slip!
Why the devil do you do such
things, Effie? What drives you to
it?"</p>

<p>She swallowed. "It's just that
it's so dreadful being cooped up
like this," she said hesitatingly,
"shut away from the sky and the
Sun. I'm just hungry for a little
beauty."</p>

<p>"And do you suppose I'm not?"
he demanded. "Don't you suppose
I want to get outside, too,
and be carefree and have a good
time? But I'm not so damn selfish
about it. I want my children to
enjoy the Sun, and my children's
children. Don't you see that that's
the all-important thing and that
we have to behave like mature
adults and make sacrifices for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hank."</p>

<p>He surveyed her slumped figure,
her lined and listless face.
"You're a fine one to talk about
hunger for beauty," he told her.
Then his voice grew softer, more
deliberate. "You haven't forgotten,
have you, Effie, that until
last month the Committee was
so concerned about your sterility?
That they were about to enter
my name on the list of those
waiting to be allotted a free
woman? Very high on the list,
too!"</p>

<p>She could nod even at that one,
but not while looking at him.
She turned away. She knew very
well that the Committee was justified
in worrying about the birth
rate. When the community finally
moved back to the surface again,
each additional healthy young
person would be an asset, not
only in the struggle for bare survival,
but in the resumed war
against Communism which some
of the Committee members still
counted on.</p>

<p>It was natural that they should
view a sterile woman with disfavor,
and not only because of
the waste of her husband's germ-plasm,
but because sterility might
indicate that she had suffered
more than the average from radiation.
In that case, if she did bear
children later on, they would be
more apt to carry a defective
heredity, producing an undue
number of monsters and freaks in
future generations, and so contaminating
the race.</p>

<p>Of course she understood it.
She could hardly remember the
time when she didn't. Years ago?
Centuries? There wasn't much
difference in a place where time
was endless.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His</span> lecture finished, her husband
smiled and grew almost
cheerful.</p>

<p>"Now that you're going to have
a child, that's all in the background
again. Do you know, Effie,
that when I first came in, I
had some very good news for
you? I'm to become a member of
the Junior Committee and the
announcement will be made at
the banquet tonight." He cut
short her mumbled congratulations.
"So brighten yourself up
and put on your best dress. I
want the other Juniors to see
what a handsome wife the new
member has got." He paused.
"Well, get a move on!"</p>

<p>She spoke with difficulty, still
not looking at him. "I'm terribly
sorry, Hank, but you'll have to
go alone. I'm not well."</p>

<p>He straightened up with an indignant
jerk. "There you go
again! First that infantile, inexcusable
business of the shutters,
and now this! No feeling for
my reputation at all. Don't be
ridiculous, Effie. You're coming!"</p>

<p>"Terribly sorry," she repeated
blindly, "but I really can't. I'd
just be sick. I wouldn't make you
proud of me at all."</p>

<p>"Of course you won't," he retorted
sharply. "As it is, I have
to spend half my energy running
around making excuses for you&mdash;why
you're so odd, why you
always seem to be ailing, why
you're always stupid and snobbish
and say the wrong thing. But
tonight's really important, Effie.
It will cause a lot of bad comment
if the new member's wife
isn't present. You know how just
a hint of sickness starts the old
radiation-disease rumor going.
You've <i>got</i> to come, Effie."</p>

<p>She shook her head helplessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, come
on!" he shouted, advancing on
her. "This is just a silly mood.
As soon as you get going, you'll
snap out of it. There's nothing
really wrong with you at all."</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder
to turn her around, and at
his touch her face suddenly grew
so desperate and gray that for a
moment he was alarmed in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"Really?" he asked, almost
with a note of concern.</p>

<p>She nodded miserably.</p>

<p>"Hmm!" He stepped back and
strode about irresolutely. "Well,
of course, if that's the way it is ..."
He checked himself and a
sad smile crossed his face. "So
you don't care enough about your
old husband's success to make
one supreme effort in spite of feeling
bad?"</p>

<p>Again the helpless headshake.
"I just can't go out tonight, under
any circumstances." And her
gaze stole toward the lead
shutters.</p>

<p>He was about to say something
when he caught the direction of
her gaze. His eyebrows jumped.
For seconds he stared at her incredulously,
as if some completely
new and almost unbelievable
possibility had popped into his
mind. The look of incredulity
slowly faded, to be replaced by
a harder, more calculating expression.
But when he spoke again,
his voice was shockingly bright
and kind.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped naturally,
and I certainly wouldn't
want you to go if you weren't
able to enjoy it. So you hop right
into bed and get a good rest. I'll
run over to the men's dorm to
freshen up. No, really, I don't
want you to have to make any
effort at all. Incidentally, Jim
Barnes isn't going to be able to
come to the banquet either&mdash;touch
of the old 'flu, he tells me,
of all things."</p>

<p>He watched her closely as he
mentioned the other man's name,
but she didn't react noticeably.
In fact, she hardly seemed to be
hearing his chatter.</p>

<p>"I got a bit sharp with you,
I'm afraid, Effie," he continued
contritely. "I'm sorry about that.
I was excited about my new job
and I guess that was why things
upset me. Made me feel let down
when I found you weren't feeling
as good as I was. Selfish of
me. Now you get into bed right
away and get well. Don't worry
about me a bit. I know you'd
come if you possibly could. And
I know you'll be thinking about
me. Well, I must be off now."</p>

<p>He started toward her, as if to
embrace her, then seemed to
think better of it. He turned back
at the doorway and said, emphasizing
the words, "You'll be completely
alone for the next four
hours." He waited for her nod,
then bounced out.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> stood still until his footsteps
died away. Then she
straightened up, walked over to
where he'd put down the wristwatch,
picked it up and smashed
it hard on the floor. The crystal
shattered, the case flew apart, and
something went <i>zing!</i></p>

<p>She stood there breathing
heavily. Slowly her sagged features
lifted, formed themselves
into the beginning of a smile.
She stole another look at the
shutters. The smile became more
definite. She felt her hair, wet
her fingers and ran them along
her hairline and back over her
ears. After wiping her hands on
her apron, she took it off. She
straightened her dress, lifted her
head with a little flourish, and
stepped smartly toward the
window.</p>

<p>Then her face went miserable
again and her steps slowed.</p>

<p>No, it couldn't be, and it won't
be, she told herself. It had been
just an illusion, a silly romantic
dream that she had somehow
projected out of her beauty-starved
mind and given a moment's
false reality. There
couldn't be anything alive outside.
There hadn't been for two
whole years.</p>

<p>And if there conceivably were,
it would be something altogether
horrible. She remembered some
of the pariahs&mdash;hairless, witless
creatures, with radiation welts
crawling over their bodies like
worms, who had come begging
for succor during the last months
of the Terror&mdash;and been shot
down. How they must have hated
the people in refuges!</p>

<p>But even as she was thinking
these things, her fingers were caressing
the bolts, gingerly drawing
them, and she was opening the
shutters gently, apprehensively.</p>

<p>No, there couldn't be anything
outside, she assured herself
wryly, peering out into the green
night. Even her fears had been
groundless.</p>

<p>But the face came floating up
toward the window. She started
back in terror, then checked herself.</p>

<p>For the face wasn't horrible at
all, only very thin, with full lips
and large eyes and a thin proud
nose like the jutting beak of a
bird. And no radiation welts or
scars marred the skin, olive in
the tempered moonlight. It
looked, in fact, just as it had
when she had seen it the first
time.</p>

<p>For a long moment the face
stared deep, deep into her brain.
Then the full lips smiled and a
half-clenched, thin-fingered hand
materialized itself from the green
darkness and rapped twice on the
grimy pane.</p>

<p>Her heart pounding, she furiously
worked the little crank that
opened the window. It came unstuck
from the frame with a
tiny explosion of dust and a <i>zing</i>
like that of the watch, only
louder. A moment later it swung
open wide and a puff of incredibly
fresh air caressed her face
and the inside of her nostrils,
stinging her eyes with unanticipated
tears.</p>

<p>The man outside balanced on
the sill, crouching like a faun,
head high, one elbow on knee.
He was dressed in scarred, snug
trousers and an old sweater.</p>

<p>"Is it tears I get for a welcome?"
he mocked her gently in
a musical voice. "Or are those
only to greet God's own breath,
the air?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> swung down inside and
now she could see he was tall.
Turning, he snapped his fingers
and called, "Come, puss."</p>

<p>A black cat with a twisted
stump of a tail and feet like small
boxing gloves and ears almost as
big as rabbits' hopped clumsily
in view. He lifted it down, gave it
a pat. Then, nodding familiarly
to Effie, he unstrapped a little
pack from his back and laid it
on the table.</p>

<p>She couldn't move. She even
found it hard to breathe.</p>

<p>"The window," she finally managed
to get out.</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly,
caught the direction of her stabbing
finger. Moving without
haste, he went over and closed it
carelessly.</p>

<p>"The shutters, too," she told
him, but he ignored that, looking
around.</p>

<p>"It's a snug enough place you
and your man have," he commented.
"Or is it that this is a
free-love town or a harem spot, or
just a military post?" He checked
her before she could answer. "But
let's not be talking about such
things now. Soon enough I'll be
scared to death for both of us.
Best enjoy the kick of meeting,
which is always good for twenty
minutes at the least." He smiled
at her rather shyly. "Have you
food? Good, then bring it."</p>

<p>She set cold meat and some
precious canned bread before him
and had water heating for coffee.
Before he fell to, he shredded a
chunk of meat and put it on the
floor for the cat, which left off
its sniffing inspection of the walls
and ran up eagerly mewing. Then
the man began to eat, chewing
each mouthful slowly and appreciatively.</p>

<p>From across the table Effie
watched him, drinking in his
every deft movement, his every
cryptic quirk of expression. She
attended to making the coffee,
but that took only a moment.
Finally she could contain herself
no longer.</p>

<p>"What's it like up there?" she
asked breathlessly. "Outside, I
mean."</p>

<p>He looked at her oddly for
quite a space. Finally, he said
flatly, "Oh, it's a wonderland for
sure, more amazing than you
tombed folk could ever imagine.
A veritable fairyland." And he
quickly went on eating.</p>

<p>"No, but really," she pressed.</p>

<p>Noting her eagerness, he smiled
and his eyes filled with playful
tenderness. "I mean it, on my
oath," he assured her. "You think
the bombs and the dust made
only death and ugliness. That
was true at first. But then, just
as the doctors foretold, they
changed the life in the seeds and
loins that were brave enough to
stay. Wonders bloomed and
walked." He broke off suddenly
and asked, "Do any of you ever
venture outside?"</p>

<p>"A few of the men are allowed
to," she told him, "for short trips
in special protective suits, to hunt
for canned food and fuels and
batteries and things like that."</p>

<p>"Aye, and those blind-souled
slugs would never see anything
but what they're looking for," he
said, nodding bitterly. "They'd
never see the garden where a
dozen buds blossom where one
did before, and the flowers have
petals a yard across, with stingless
bees big as sparrows gently
supping their nectar. Housecats
grown spotted and huge as leopards
(not little runts like Joe
Louis here) stalk through those
gardens. But they're gentle beasts,
no more harmful than the rainbow-scaled
snakes that glide
around their paws, for the dust
burned all the murder out of
them, as it burned itself out.</p>

<p>"I've even made up a little
poem about that. It starts, 'Fire
can hurt me, or water, or the
weight of Earth. But the dust is
my friend.' Oh, yes, and then the
robins like cockatoos and squirrels
like a princess's ermine! All
under a treasure chest of Sun and
Moon and stars that the dust's
magic powder changes from ruby
to emerald and sapphire and
amethyst and back again. Oh,
and then the new children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're telling the truth?" she
interrupted him, her eyes brimming
with tears. "You're not
making it up?"</p>

<p>"I am not," he assured her
solemnly. "And if you could catch
a glimpse of one of the new children,
you'd never doubt me again.
They have long limbs as brown
as this coffee would be if it had
lots of fresh cream in it, and
smiling delicate faces and the
whitish teeth and the finest hair.
They're so nimble that I&mdash;a
sprightly man and somewhat enlivened
by the dust&mdash;feel like a
cripple beside them. And their
thoughts dance like flames and
make me feel a very imbecile.</p>

<p>"Of course, they have seven
fingers on each hand and eight
toes on each foot, but they're the
more beautiful for that. They
have large pointed ears that the
Sun shines through. They play
in the garden, all day long, slipping
among the great leaves and
blooms, but they're so swift that
you can hardly see them, unless
one chooses to stand still and look
at you. For that matter, you have
to look a bit hard for all these
things I'm telling you."</p>

<p>"But it is true?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Every word of it," he said,
looking straight into her eyes. He
put down his knife and fork.
"What's your name?" he asked
softly. "Mine's Patrick."</p>

<p>"Effie," she told him.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "That can't
be," he said. Then his face
brightened. "Euphemia," he exclaimed.
"That's what Effie is
short for. Your name is Euphemia."
As he said that, looking
at her, she suddenly felt beautiful.
He got up and came around the
table and stretched out his hand
toward her.</p>

<p>"Euphemia&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she answered huskily,
shrinking from him a little, but
looking up sideways, and very
flushed.</p>

<p>"Don't either of you move,"
Hank said.</p>

<p>The voice was flat and nasal
because Hank was wearing a nose
respirator that was just long
enough to suggest an elephant's
trunk. In his right hand was a
large blue-black automatic pistol.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> turned their faces to
him. Patrick's was abruptly
alert, shifty. But Effie's was still
smiling tenderly, as if Hank could
not break the spell of the magic
garden and should be pitied for
not knowing about it.</p>

<p>"You little&mdash;" Hank began
with an almost gleeful fury, calling
her several shameful names.
He spoke in short phrases, closing
tight his unmasked mouth between
them while he sucked in
breath through the respirator. His
voice rose in a crescendo. "And
not with a man of the community,
but a pariah! <i>A pariah!</i>"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what you're
thinking, man, but you're quite
wrong," Patrick took the opportunity
to put in hurriedly, conciliatingly.
"I just happened to
be coming by hungry tonight, a
lonely tramp, and knocked at the
window. Your wife was a bit
foolish and let kindheartedness
get the better of prudence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think you've pulled the
wool over my eyes, Effie," Hank
went on with a screechy laugh,
disregarding the other man completely.
"Don't think I don't
know why you're suddenly going
to have a child after four long
years."</p>

<p>At that moment the cat came
nosing up to his feet. Patrick
watched him narrowly, shifting
his weight forward a little, but
Hank only kicked the animal
aside without taking his eyes
off them.</p>

<p>"Even that business of carrying
the wristwatch in your pocket
instead of on your arm," he went
on with channeled hysteria. "A
neat bit of camouflage, Effie. Very
neat. And telling me it was my
child, when all the while you've
been seeing him for months!"</p>

<p>"Man, you're mad; I've not
touched her!" Patrick denied
hotly though still calculatingly,
and risked a step forward, stopping
when the gun instantly
swung his way.</p>

<p>"Pretending you were going to
give me a healthy child," Hank
raved on, "when all the while
you knew it would be&mdash;either in
body or germ plasm&mdash;a thing like
<i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>He waved his gun at the malformed
cat, which had leaped to
the top of the table and was eating
the remains of Patrick's food,
though its watchful green eyes
were fixed on Hank.</p>

<p>"I should shoot him down!"
Hank yelled, between sobbing,
chest-racking inhalations through
the mask. "I should kill him this
instant for the contaminated
pariah he is!"</p>

<p>All this while Effie had not
ceased to smile compassionately.
Now she stood up without haste
and went to Patrick's side. Disregarding
his warning, apprehensive
glance, she put her arm
lightly around him and faced her
husband.</p>

<p>"Then you'd be killing the
bringer of the best news we've
ever had," she said, and her
voice was like a flood of some
warm sweet liquor in that musty,
hate-charged room. "Oh, Hank,
forget your silly, wrong jealousy
and listen to me. Patrick here has
something wonderful to tell us."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Hank</span> stared at her. For once
he screamed no reply. It
was obvious that he was seeing
for the first time how beautiful
she had become, and that the
realization jolted him terribly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he finally
asked unevenly, almost
fearfully.</p>

<p>"I mean that we no longer need
to fear the dust," she said, and
now her smile was radiant. "It
never really did hurt people the
way the doctors said it would.
Remember how it was with me,
Hank, the exposure I had and recovered
from, although the doctors
said I wouldn't at first&mdash;and
without even losing my hair?
Hank, those who were brave
enough to stay outside, and who
weren't killed by terror and suggestion
and panic&mdash;they adapted
to the dust. They changed, but
they changed for the better. Everything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Effie, he told you lies!" Hank
interrupted, but still in that same
agitated, broken voice, cowed by
her beauty.</p>

<p>"Everything that grew or
moved was purified," she went
on ringingly. "You men going
outside have never seen it, because
you've never had eyes for
it. You've been blinded to beauty,
to life itself. And now all the
power in the dust has gone and
faded, anyway, burned itself out.
That's true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She smiled at Patrick for confirmation.
His face was strangely
veiled, as if he were calculating
obscure changes. He might have
given a little nod; at any rate,
Effie assumed that he did, for
she turned back to her husband.</p>

<p>"You see, Hank? We can all
go out now. We need never fear
the dust again. Patrick is a living
proof of that," she continued
triumphantly, standing straighter,
holding him a little tighter. "Look
at him. Not a scar or a sign, and
he's been out in the dust for
years. How could he be this way,
if the dust hurt the brave? Oh,
believe me, Hank! Believe what
you see. Test it if you want. Test
Patrick here."</p>

<p>"Effie, you're all mixed up.
You don't know&mdash;" Hank faltered,
but without conviction of
any sort.</p>

<p>"Just test him," Effie repeated
with utter confidence, ignoring&mdash;not
even noticing&mdash;Patrick's
warning nudge.</p>

<p>"All right," Hank mumbled.
He looked at the stranger dully.
"Can you count?" he asked.</p>

<p>Patrick's face was a complete
enigma. Then he suddenly spoke,
and his voice was like a fencer's
foil&mdash;light, bright, alert, constantly
playing, yet utterly on
guard.</p>

<p>"Can I count? Do you take me
for a complete simpleton, man?
Of course I can count!"</p>

<p>"Then count yourself," Hank
said, barely indicating the table.</p>

<p>"Count myself, should I?" the
other retorted with a quick facetious
laugh. "Is this a kindergarten?
But if you want me to,
I'm willing." His voice was rapid.
"I've two arms, and two legs,
that's four. And ten fingers and
ten toes&mdash;you'll take my word for
them?&mdash;that's twenty-four. A
head, twenty-five. And two eyes
and a nose and a mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With this, I mean," Hank said
heavily, advanced to the table,
picked up the Geiger counter,
switched it on, and handed it
across the table to the other man.</p>

<p>But while it was still an arm's
length from Patrick, the clicks
began to mount furiously, until
they were like the chatter of a
pigmy machine gun. Abruptly
the clicks slowed, but that was
only the counter shifting to a
new scaling circuit, in which each
click stood for 512 of the old
ones.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> those horrid, rattling
little volleys, fear cascaded
into the room and filled it, smashing
like so much colored glass all
the bright barriers of words Effie
had raised against it. For no
dreams can stand against the
Geiger counter, the Twentieth
Century's mouthpiece of ultimate
truth. It was as if the dust and
all the terrors of the dust had incarnated
themselves in one dread
invading shape that said in words
stronger than audible speech,
"Those were illusions, whistles in
the dark. This is reality, the
dreary, pitiless reality of the
Burrowing Years."</p>

<p>Hank scuttled back to the wall.
Through chattering teeth he
babbled, "... enough radioactives
... kill a thousand men
... freak ... a freak ..." In
his agitation he forgot for a moment
to inhale through the respirator.</p>

<p>Even Effie&mdash;taken off guard,
all the fears that had been drilled
into her twanging like piano
wires&mdash;shrank from the skeletal-seeming
shape beside her, held
herself to it only by desperation.</p>

<p>Patrick did it for her. He disengaged
her arm and stepped
briskly away. Then he whirled on
them, smiling sardonically, and
started to speak, but instead
looked with distaste at the chattering
Geiger counter he held between
fingers and thumb.</p>

<p>"Have we listened to this racket
long enough?" he asked.</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer,
he put down the instrument on
the table. The cat hurried over
to it curiously and the clicks began
again to mount in a minor
crescendo. Effie lunged for it
frantically, switched it off, darted
back.</p>

<p>"That's right," Patrick said
with another chilling smile. "You
do well to cringe, for I'm death
itself. Even in death I could kill
you, like a snake." And with that
his voice took on the tones of a
circus barker. "Yes, I'm a freak,
as the gentleman so wisely said.
That's what one doctor who
dared talk with me for a minute
told me before he kicked me out.
He couldn't tell me why, but
somehow the dust doesn't kill me.
Because I'm a freak, you see, just
like the men who ate nails and
walked on fire and ate arsenic
and stuck themselves through
with pins. Step right up, ladies
and gentlemen&mdash;only not too
close!&mdash;and examine the man the
dust can't harm. Rappaccini's
child, brought up to date; his
embrace, death!</p>

<p>"And now," he said, breathing
heavily, "I'll get out and leave
you in your damned lead cave."</p>

<p>He started toward the window.
Hank's gun followed him shakingly.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Effie called in an
agonized voice. He obeyed. She
continued falteringly, "When we
were together earlier, you didn't
act as if ..."</p>

<p>"When we were together earlier,
I wanted what I wanted,"
he snarled at her. "You don't suppose
I'm a bloody saint, do you?"</p>

<p>"And all the beautiful things
you told me?"</p>

<p>"That," he said cruelly, "is just
a line I've found that women
fall for. They're all so bored and
so starved for beauty&mdash;as <i>they</i>
generally put it."</p>

<p>"Even the garden?" Her question
was barely audible through
the sobs that threatened to suffocate
her.</p>

<p>He looked at her and perhaps
his expression softened just a
trifle.</p>

<p>"What's outside," he said flatly,
"is just a little worse than either
of you can imagine." He tapped
his temple. "The garden's all
here."</p>

<p>"You've killed it," she wept.
"You've killed it in me. You've
both killed everything that's
beautiful. But you're worse," she
screamed at Patrick, "because he
only killed beauty once, but you
brought it to life just so you
could kill it again. Oh, I can't
stand it! I won't stand it!" And
she began to scream.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="395" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Patrick started toward her, but
she broke off and whirled away
from him to the window, her eyes
crazy.</p>

<p>"You've been lying to us," she
cried. "The garden's there. I know
it is. But you don't want to share
it with anyone."</p>

<p>"No, no, Euphemia," Patrick
protested anxiously. "It's hell out
there, believe me. I wouldn't lie
to you about it."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't lie to me!" she
mocked. "Are you afraid, too?"</p>

<p>With a sudden pull, she jerked
open the window and stood before
the blank green-tinged oblong
of darkness that seemed to
press into the room like a menacing,
heavy, wind-urged curtain.</p>

<p>At that Hank cried out
a shocked, pleading, "Effie!"</p>

<p>She ignored him. "I can't be
cooped up here any longer," she
said. "And I won't, now that I
know. I'm going to the garden."</p>

<p>Both men sprang at her, but
they were too late. She leaped
lightly to the sill, and by the
time they had flung themselves
against it, her footsteps were already
hurrying off into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Effie, come back! Come
back!" Hank shouted after her
desperately, no longer thinking
to cringe from the man beside
him, or how the gun was pointed.
"I love you, Effie. Come back!"</p>

<p>Patrick added his voice. "Come
back, Euphemia. You'll be safe
if you come back right away.
Come back to your home."</p>

<p>No answer to that at all.</p>

<p>They both strained their eyes
through the greenish murk. They
could barely make out a shadowy
figure about half a block down
the near-black canyon of the
dismal, dust-blown street, into
which the greenish moonlight
hardly reached. It seemed to
them that the figure was scooping
something up from the pavement
and letting it sift down along its
arms and over its bosom.</p>

<p>"Go out and get her, man,"
Patrick urged the other. "For if
I go out for her, I warn you I
won't bring her back. She said
something about having stood the
dust better than most, and that's
enough for me."</p>

<p>But Hank, chained by his
painfully learned habits and by
something else, could not move.</p>

<p>And then a ghostly voice came
whispering down the street,
chanting, "Fire can hurt me, or
water, or the weight of Earth.
But the dust is my friend."</p>

<p>Patrick spared the other man
one more look. Then, without a
word, he vaulted up and ran off.</p>

<p>Hank stood there. After perhaps
a half minute he remembered
to close his mouth when he
inhaled. Finally he was sure the
street was empty. As he started
to close the window, there was a
little <i>mew</i>.</p>

<p>He picked up the cat and
gently put it outside. Then he
did close the window, and the
shutters, and bolted them, and
took up the Geiger counter, and
mechanically began to count
himself.</p>
